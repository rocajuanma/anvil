  - Unified multiple `copyFile` and `copyDirRecursive` implementations into single utilities
  - Added configurable options for copy behavior while maintaining backward compatibility
  - **Benefit**: Follows DRY principle and provides consistent filesystem operations

### Fixed

  - Now matches `anvil config show` and `anvil config push` commands which accept optional arguments
  - When no directory is specified, defaults to pulling from "anvil" directory
  - `anvil config pull` is now equivalent to `anvil config pull anvil`

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
