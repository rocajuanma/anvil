### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Command renamed from `setup` to `install` - All `anvil setup` commands are now `anvil install`

  - `anvil push` ‚Üí `anvil config push [directory]` (in development)
  - This change improves command hierarchy and follows Cobra best practices
  - All documentation updated to reflect new command structure with directory-specific operations
- **Enhanced Configuration Structure** - Updated settings.yaml with GitHub and Git configuration sections
  - Added `github.config_repo`, `github.branch`, `github.local_path`, `github.token_env_var`
  - Added `git.ssh_key_path`, `git.ssh_dir` for SSH configuration
  - Automatic GitHub URL format validation and correction
- **Improved Error Messages** - Branch configuration errors now provide detailed guidance
  - Lists available branches when specified branch doesn't exist
  - Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions with settings file path
  - Enhanced validation messages during repository access
- Enhanced progress indicators

### Fixed

- **Codebase Cleanup** - Removed unused code and simplified directory structure
  - Removed unused `.anvil/cache` and `.anvil/data` directories from entire codebase
  - Simplified `AnvilDirectories` struct to only include `Config` field
  - Removed concurrent installation features, unused error constructors, and extended package constants
  - Cleaned up placeholder implementations and unused flags
- Memory usage optimization for large tool sets
- Updated import paths for reorganized command structure

## [1.0.1] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
